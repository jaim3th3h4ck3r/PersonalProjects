# Personal Projects
Personal Projects is just a repo with a bunch of random crap I made. Mostly small programs full of spaguetti code with few comments,
though I will try to make it more readable and more standard-compliant as time goes on.

Peruse at your own risk. Everything I provide comes with zero warranty of it working or not breaking your machine.
